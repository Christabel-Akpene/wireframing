# Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide or blueprint that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product. It focuses on layout, structure and functionality rather than detailed design elements like colors or typography.

## Importance of Wireframing in the design process
- It helps to translate abstract objects into tangible layouts.
- It identifies potential usability issues early.
- It facilitates better communication between designers, developers and clients.


## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A well-designed wireframe includes several core components that define how the user will interact with the interface. Below are the key elements and their roles in the overall design:

### 1. Layout Structure
The layout structure represents the overall arrangement of elements on a page or screen. It defines how space is divided among different sections such as headers, sidebars, content areas, and footers.  
**Example:** A website wireframe may feature a fixed header for navigation, a main content area in the center, and a footer for contact information. This helps maintain a consistent design across multiple pages.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation elements guide users through the interface and help them find information quickly. Common navigation features include menus, tabs, and breadcrumbs.  
**Example:** A navigation bar at the top of a website allows users to access the homepage, about page, and contact section easily, ensuring a smooth user journey.

### 3. Content Placement
Content placement determines where key information, images, and calls to action (CTAs) will appear. Proper placement ensures that important content is visible and easy to engage with.  
**Example:** Positioning a “Sign Up” button prominently on a landing page increases conversion rates by drawing attention to the primary action.

### 4. Functionality
Functionality outlines interactive elements within the design, such as buttons, forms, sliders, or dropdown menus. These components show how users will interact with the product.  
**Example:** A login form wireframe might include text fields for username and password with a “Remember Me” checkbox, demonstrating the intended user interaction flow.
